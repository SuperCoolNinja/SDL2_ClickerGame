# Simple Clicker game made using SDL2 with CPP (WIP).
I made a remake of my love2d clicker game project using SDL2 with CPP for learning how SDL2 work (this project is still in progress).

## Screen :

## Description of the game logic :
You have a circle shape that pops pup where you must click to increase your score.

The challenge for you will be to click as fast as you can on the shape that spawns all with a timer that shows you the elapsed time.

Each time you click on the circular shape, the color of the shape will change randomly as well as its position.
Good luck and have fun.
